        <p>As part of the <a href="/our_work/mapping.html">East Palo Alto Mapping Youth Resource Mapping</a> project, the JGC developed an online program mapping tool that allows users to search for programs by time, content, location, or age range. In addition, the JGC facilitated a youth research project that introduced community members to the mapping tool and gathered feedback on how to improve usability of the tool.</p>

        <h5><a href="http://www.communityschools.org/resources/community_schools_evaluation_toolkit.aspx">Community Schools Evaluation Toolkit</a></h5>
        <p>This toolkit created in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Schools is designed to help community schools evaluate their efforts so that they learn from their successes, identify current challenges, and plan future efforts. It provides a step-by-step process for planning and conducting an evaluation at your community school site(s). The toolkit is a practical, hands-on guide that makes it possible for you to improve your community school’s effectiveness and to tell your story. Equally important, it offers a menu of data collection tools (i.e. surveys, public databases) for evaluating whether and how your school is achieving results.</p>

        <h5><a href="http://johnwgardnertestsite.pbworks.com/w/page/13471102/BASICS%20Toolkit">BASICS Toolkit: Building, Assessing, Sustaining, and Improving Community Schools (limited release edition) (Mar 2009)</h5>
        <p>The BASICS Toolkit (Building, Assessing, Sustaining and Improving Community Schools) was developed as a resource for school and community organization staff and technical assistance providers working with community schools at all stages of development.

        <h5><a href="/resources/tools/0807_RWC_YD_Directory.pdf">Youth Development Resource Directory (Jun 2008)</a></h5>
        <p>This directory was compiled in winter of 2008 to support the JGC’s Youth in the Middle Initiative. The organizations in the directory provide resources and services related to the implementation of youth development principles, such as assessment tools, trainings, and practice materials. Although we created this as a resource for local youth development practioners in San Mateo County, with a focus on Redwood City, we hope that it will prove valuable outside this localized scope as well.</p>
