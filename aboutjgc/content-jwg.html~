		<h4>The Man Behind Our Mission</h4>
		<h3><img class="alignleft" src="/images/jwg3.jpg"  />
	"John Gardner stands as an exemplar of the power of one individual to have a positive
impact on society," said Stanford President John Hennessy at the time of Gardner’s death in
2002. "His life should remind all of us that education and public service can work together
as a powerful force to improve the world in which we live. At Stanford, we are exceedingly
fortunate and proud to have called him our colleague -- his name and good works will
continue to inspire students, staff and faculty for years to come."</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John W. Gardner was born in Los Angeles on Oct. 8, 1912. He earned a bachelor's and a
master's degree in psychology from Stanford in 1935 and 1936, respectively. In 1938, he
received a doctorate from the University of California Berkeley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gardner began his working life teaching psychology at Connecticut College for Women. As
the United States entered World War II, he was asked to head the Latin American section of
the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service and, in 1943, he joined the Marine Corps. After
the war ended, he joined the Carnegie Corporation, becoming its president in 1955. Gardner
also was named head of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and,
in that capacity, laid the groundwork for establishing the White House Fellows program in
1964.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the 1960s onward, John W. Gardner played a major role in civil rights enforcement,
education reform and campaign finance reform. He was instrumental in the creation of
Medicare, in establishing the public television network and supporting community volunteer
service. In 1964, Gardner received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest
civil honor. He founded Common Cause and headed the Urban Coalition, chaired numerous
presidential task forces and commissions and mentored many public service organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="/images/jwg1.jpg"  />In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Gardner secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare. As the engineer of Johnson's "Great Society" program, he
played an important role in enforcing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, launching Medicare, passing
the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and creating the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. At one point, Fortune magazine estimated that Gardner supervised programs
that affected 195 million Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1968, as opposition to the war in Vietnam increased and urban violence erupted at home,
Gardner resigned from the Johnson Administration. A few weeks later, he became chairman
of the Urban Coalition, an organization that brought together leaders from labor, industry
and government to tackle the underlying problems that fueled riots in cities nationwide that
year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1970, Gardner founded Common Cause, a citizen's advocacy group that aimed to make
political institutions more open and accountable. When the group sued President Richard
Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, Gardner was placed on Nixon's infamous "enemies
list." In 1974, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Common Cause was instrumental in
gaining adoption of landmark legislation that placed limits on political contributions and
instituted disclosure requirements for electoral campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1977, Gardner retired from Common Cause to become chairman of the Commission
on White House Fellowships. Two years later, he co-founded Independent Sector, an
organization that supported hundreds of non-profit groups nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/images/jwg2.jpg"  />In the fall of 2000, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities was
established at Stanford, in honor of Gardner's lifetime of public service. Speaking at the
Center’s opening, Gardner said the public had finally understood the importance of youth
development. "If you want to train leaders you have to start early," he said. "If you want to
keep kids out of prison you have to start early. But it isn't easily done." The center's mission
is to conduct research, educate the public and persuade diverse groups such as schools,
law enforcement and government to work together to seek more effective solutions to the
problems facing youth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a simple, easily forgotten truth that we need one another," Gardner said in the PBS
documentary John Gardner: Uncommon American. "I sometimes think that history might
easily say about this nation: ‘It was a great nation full of talented people with enormous
energy who forgot that they needed one another.'" The documentary aired on the Public
Broadcasting Service in the fall of 2001. (For more information, visit http://www.pbs.org/

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gardner wrote several books, including, Excellence: Can We Be Equal and Excellent Too?
The 1961 book argued that the United States must strive for excellence and equality at
every level of society. It caught the attention of President John F. Kennedy, who asked
Gardner to edit his 1962 book, To Turn the Tide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1964, Gardner wrote Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society. In
this book, his most popular, Gardner reflected on individual renewal and the renewal of
society. "Failure to face the realities of change brings heavy penalties," he said. "Individuals
become imprisoned in their own rigidities. Great institutions deteriorate. Civilizations fall.
Yet decay is not inevitable. There is also renewal."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Stanford, Gardner served on the Stanford Board of Trustees from 1968 to 1982. In
1965, the Alumni Association honored him with the Herbert Hoover Medal for Distinguished
Service. As an undergraduate, Gardner set a number of Pacific Coast intercollegiate records
in swimming and, in 1976, he was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Medal of the
Stanford Athletic Board. In 1984, Stanford Associates awarded him with the Degree of
Uncommon Man, the university's highest honor. In 1989, Gardner was named the first
Miriam and Peter Haas Centennial Professor in Public Service. He was a consulting professor
in the School of Education at the time of his death.</p>
